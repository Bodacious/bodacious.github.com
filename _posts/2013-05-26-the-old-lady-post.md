Today was the sunniest day we've had in Edinburgh all year!

I spent the early part of the afternoon sitting out in The Meadows reading. 
A guy I know walked by pushing an elderly, weak lady in a wheelchair. 
He's a care worker and I guess was taking her out for a walk to enjoy the sunshine.

He saw me. I waved and shouted something about how great the weather was. He responded 
with "Yea, it's too bad I'm working!" and gestured down to the woman sitting in front of him.

I'm sure she felt utterly worthless.

The reality of her situation, and so many other people in care, is that there's nobody around 
who'd willingly take them out to enjoy the sunshine, so their family or the state pays someone to.
