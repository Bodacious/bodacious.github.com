... that it's almost always in vain.

We all worry from time to time. Some worry more than others, but we all do it.

We worry though, almost invariably, about things that never actually come to pass. Instead, we worry about threats that we've imagined - fantasies.

Worrying, regardless of whether the thing we worry about happens or not, is a pointless exerecise. It saps our energy, erodes our health, and restricts our ability to think of creative solutions to the problems that we really do encounter.

## How To Worry Less

Worrying is not something that we can just turn off and on like a switch. Worrying is a habit and a mindset and, as with any habit, it takes time and concerted effort to break out of.  Learning not to worry is personal journey and, if I'm honest, I still have a long way to go on mine.  Here are a few things I've learned so far though...

### Frame The Problem

This is a trick my friend Avi taught me a few years ago over tacos in New Jersey. When you're anxious about something, take some time to ask yourself the question "Why am I worried about this?" and write your answer down.

Often, we worry because of the unknown. Uncertainty means possible change. There's a chance that we might lose something important to us, or that our lives could get worse. Not knowing what will happen leads us to imagine the worse of possiblities. Of course, there's also a chance that things could get better too, or not change at all but we don't often consider those.

Writing down *why* you're worried helps to frame the problem, makes it more tangible, and allows you to break it into smaller pieces and analyse it. For example, your company is making staff cuts and this has everyone feeling anxious. But consider: "If I lose my job, then what?". "Well, I'll be able to find another job, maybe I'll even a better job!".

Our minds find large and complex questions stressful. Problems always seem less daunting when we take the time to break them down into smaller, manageable pieces and define them.

The unhappiness is often temporary, we usually revert back to our base level of happiness http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16719675.

### Write A Worry List

This is something I came up with ealier this year. At the time, I had a few great opporutnities to really worry, and the stress was taking it's toll on my work and my health. I sat at my desk and started framing the problem when I had an idea...

I grabbed my notebook and made a list of all of the things I've spent time and energy worrying about in the past few years. I filled three pages. Front, and back. I'm sure I missed out quite a few, but these were the ones that were significant enough for me to remember off-hand.

Once I'd written the list, I attempted to circle every one of the things I'd worried about that actually came to pass. There wasn't one. Every significant, *bad* or unfortunate event in my life has completely blind-sided me, probably while I was busy worrying about something else.

We are terrible at accurately predicting the future, and realising that helps to reassure us that the things we worry about are usually just in our own imagniations.

### Distract Yourself

A [recent study by Harvard University](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/330/6006/932.abstract "A Wandering Mind Is An Unhappy Mind") shows that when our minds wander, we are less happy.  By contrast, when we're occupied we are more happy. 

Spending a lot of time alone, or idly fretting about your problems only leads to more anxiety, which in turn will cause you to think of even more things to worry about. When something is on your mind and you really can't stop worrying, call or spend time with a friend. Take some time to do something you love. Read a book. Play with your kids or pets. By doing something you enjoy, you'll naturally improve your mood and relax, which will eventually reassure your mind that it's OK to stop worrying.

Here are some great quotes about worrying. Not only do they reinforce the point that we worry in vain, it's also comforting to know that when you are worried, you're not alone - we all do it from time to time.
