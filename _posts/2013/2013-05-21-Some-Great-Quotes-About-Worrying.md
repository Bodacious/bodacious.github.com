description: "Here are some quotes about worrying from some of history's great thinkers.
Not only do they help reinforce the point that worrying is almost always in vain, it's also

We all worry from time to time. Some worry more than others, but we all do it.

Almost invariably, the things we worry about never actually come to pass. Instead, we worry about threats that we've imagined and frightening fantasies that we've conjured up ourselves.

Worrying, regardless of whether the thing we worry about happens or not, is a pointless exerecise. It drains our energy, erodes our health, and restricts our ability to think of creative solutions to the problems that we really do encounter.

Here are some quotes about worrying from some of history's great thinkers. The message I read in each of these is the same: "Please don't make the mistake I've made so often - don't waste your time worrying."
