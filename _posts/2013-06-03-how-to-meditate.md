Meditation has gained a much larger, mainstream following in recent years, and with good reason. What was previously considered an esoteric, *eastern*, mystical practice, or something for "hippies", is proving to be a very powerful tool for improving physical health, emotional health, mood, mental performance and even sporting performance!

Take [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16979106 "The experience of transcendental meditation in middle school students: a qualitative report.
") in which a group of school students who tried transcendental meditation for a year, exhibited improved  restful alertness, emotional intelligence (self-control,  awareness, and flexibility in emotional response), and improvement in academic performance.

Each year there are numerous scientific studies and controlled experiments, each showing that meditation improves the lives of all regular practitioners in at least some way. 

I was recently telling a close friend about mindfulness meditation. He was eager to give it a try but wanted to know more about *how* to meditate and where to begin.  Well, there are a few  different types of meditation and a lot of variations on how to approach each.  Type of meditation I practice is called Mindfulness Meditation, and involves being aware of your current  physical and mental state, and focussing on something simple, and contant, like the breath.

## How I Meditate

The following is a guide based on how I've been meditating for the past few months. I'd encourage you to start with this simple approach, but also to read up on other approaches. Tweak the process until you find what suits you best.

1. I usually meditate in the morning.  I'm an early riser and the first hour or so of the day is my quiet, alone time.  I've tried meditating in the evenings too but I find I'm more likely to forget. Experiment until you find a time that suits you.

2. Find someplace where you can be alone. Meditating is like going to the bathroom; there's no shame in doing it, but it can be a little harder to relax when there's someone there watching you.

3. Sit up straight with your chest out, your pelvis is tilted slightly forward and your back is straight and supportive. Keep your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on your lap. Don't get too concerned about the posture here, the important thing is that you're not slouching, or so comfortable that you're likely to fall asleep. Remember, meditation is about training attentiveness.

4. Take a few deep, slow breaths in and out. This in itself is a good way to start to unwind. A few slow, deep, controlled breaths lowers the heart-rate and helps to reduce tension. 

5. Close your eyes and take a minute or two just to *check in* see how you're feeling. What's your underlying mood? How do you feel physically? Any tension in your muscles? Any aches and pains?

6. Afer *checking in*, start to count your breaths, both in breaths and out, to the count of ten. Your breathing should be normal, just in and out through the nose. You're not trying to put yourself in a trance here, or to fall asleep, or contemplate the Meaning Of Life. Instead, what you want is to sink into a sort of relaxed awareness where you can be aware of yourself and your environment without making judgments or responding.

7. Continue to count your breaths, starting back at one once you've reached ten. If, at any point you realise your mind has wandered, don't get frustrated. Simply resume counting your in and out breaths again. Keeping focus on the breath will soon get easier as you gain more experience with the practice.

8. To finish your session, try to ease out gently. You can stop counting the breaths and start focussing more on your physical sensations again. The feeling of your hands resting in your lap, the smells in the room, the ambiant sounds etc. When you're ready, open your eyes and familiarise yourself with your surroundings once again.

And that's it! A session for me usually lasts around thirty minutes, but I built up to that. If it's your first time meditating, I'd recommend starting with a [kaizen approach](/What-Is-Kaizen/ "What is Kaizen?") until you get into the habit.
