title: "For Years I Was Smart, I Recommend Pleasant"

description: "In this world, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant. While smart can often feel emotionally satisfying, the reward from being right and out-doing others is short lived. On the other hand, being pleasant brings out the best in you, and those around you. By focussing your attention on what's best for the others around you, you'll be able to get more out of life yourself, work and relationships."

"In this world, you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant..."

Smart always has to be right. Smart makes others feel bad or inferior. Smart always leads the converation. Smart has to *win* the argument.  Smart tears others down.
Smart alienates itself. Smart allows pride to get in the way of progress. Smart regularly misses opportunities to grow. Smart is insecure.

Pleasant can learn from being wrong. Pleasant makes others feel valued and involved. Pleasant learns from showing a genuine interest in what others have to say. Pleasant avoids conflicts and looks for agreeable solutions. Pleasant builds others up. Pleasant finds it easy to make new friends and connections. Pleasant improves the mood of everybody around. Pleasant gets a "yes", when smart often gets a "no". Pleasant is remarkable. 

"...Well, for years I was smart. I recommend pleasant."
