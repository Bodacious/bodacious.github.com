Ways in which meditation physically changes your brain!

Since last Autumn, I've been meditating regularly most mornings. Meditation was something I was initially reluctant to try. 
It always seemed so mystyical - one of those weird, eastern, spiritual rituals that really held no appeal in the daily life 
of a pragmatic realist like myself. The more I find out about meditation though, the more it excites me.

Increased glyrification (http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Gyrification) -

"Though the research did not prove this directly, scientists suspect that gyrification is responsible for making the brain better at processing information, making decisions, forming memories, and improving attention."

Resulting in more positive emotions, the retention of emotional stability, and more mindful behavior (heightened focus during day-to-day living)
known to be important for learning and memory, and in structures associated with self-awareness, compassion and introspection. 

Changes in brain metabolites

"specifically those metabolites linked to anxiety and depression."

"In the mindful attention group, the after-training brain scans showed a decrease in activation in the right amygdala in response to all images, supporting the hypothesis that meditation can improve emotional stability and response to stress. In the compassion meditation group, right amygdala activity also decreased in response to positive or neutral images. But among those who reported practicing compassion meditation most frequently outside of the training sessions, right amygdala activity tended to increase in response to negative images -- all of which depicted some form of human suffering. No significant changes were seen in the control group or in the left amygdala of any study participants."
